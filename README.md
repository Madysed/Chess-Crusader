First, place the assets file in the directory with the code files or executable files.
To start the game, one person will host, and the other will join them. When the first player clicks on an executable file (for example, a batch file), they enter their name first. If they donâ€™t have a previously saved game, they click on "New Game," and the second player enters their name and clicks "Join".

Play with your friends!
